## Problem Statement:
In the rapidly evolving fashion industry, consumers are inundated with an abundance of clothing options, making it challenging to discover and curate personalized styles that resonate with their preferences and tastes. As a result, there is a growing demand for intelligent fashion recommender systems that can assist users in navigating the vast array of fashion choices and curate personalized recommendations tailored to their unique style preferences, body types, and occasions.


## Project Description:
This project aims to develop a fashion recommendation system using soft computing techniques, specifically artificial intelligence and machine learning. The system analyzes user data and image attributes to generate tailored recommendations that align with individual tastes. This system leverages the power of Azure AI Translator Services to not only provide personalized fashion recommendations but also facilitate seamless cross-language interactions for a truly global audience. It aims to create an immersive and user-friendly platform that transcends language barriers. By seamlessly integrating language translation and personalized recommendations, this app aims to bring users closer to a diverse world of fashion.


## Key Features :
1. User Profiling
2. Content-based Filtering
3. Collaborative Filtering
4. Hybrid Recommender Systems
5. Real-time Personalization
6. Social Integration


## Prerequisites:
Azure Subscription: Make sure you have an active Azure subscription.
Azure Virtual Machine: Ensure that you have a virtual machine (VM) or another resource for which you want to monitor CPU usage.
Azure Ai Translator Service: Ensure that you have translator service key, region and endpoint to translate the web content.


## Setup:
Dependencies: Ensure required libraries and frameworks are installed. Include translation API keys for language support.
Configuration: Adjust system parameters, collaborative filtering weights, and translation settings in the configuration file.
Training: Train machine learning models using historical data for optimal performance. Set up translation model if applicable


## Azure Services Used:

# Azure Core Services
1. Azure Virtual Machine:
Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are on-demand, scalable computing resources provided by Microsoft Azure. They enable you to run virtualized Windows or Linux servers in the cloud. Here are some key points about Azure Virtual Machines

# Azure AI Service
Azure AI Translator Service :
The core of the translation functionality is powered by Azure AI Translator service. This service employs advanced natural language processing algorithms to provide accurate and contextually relevant translations across a wide array of languages. Azure AI Translator Service is the engine behind the Movie Recommender System app language translation capabilities. It employs advanced natural language processing to deliver accurate and contextually relevant translations.
